# Journaler

A Markdown-based journaling system that organizes articles by category and subject, generating dynamic Tables of Contents automatically.

## ⚠️ Work in Progress

Currently under development, it **does not do anything important yet**.  

---

## Planned Features

- Automatically scan journal entries
- Extract categories and subjects from folder names
- Generate a per-year timeline (`Timeline.md`)
- Generate a table of contents for all entries
- Generate and use metadata into markdown files to detect updates (Publish & UpdateDate)
- Maintain kebab-case file naming

---

## Notes

- I may add configuration maybe even a way to make it flexible but note that I might not either, depends on if I feel like it or not
